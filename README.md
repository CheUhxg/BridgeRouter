# BridgeRouter  

## Project Background 🌟  

BridgeRouter is a toolkit designed to assist in researching kernel vulnerability exploitation. It includes two core tools:  

• **identifier**: Statically analyzes kernel source code to identify potential specific objects, such as critical kernel structures or functions.  
• **trigger**: Generates targeted trigger code based on the results identified by `identifier`, enabling validation and exploitation of these objects' functionalities.  

With BridgeRouter, researchers can quickly locate potential kernel vulnerabilities and generate corresponding trigger code, significantly improving analysis efficiency and reducing repetitive tasks.  

## Environment Setup 🛠️  

Before using BridgeRouter, ensure your environment meets the following requirements:  

### System Requirements  
• Linux OS (recommended: Ubuntu 20.04+ or CentOS 8+)  
• 64-bit OS  

### Source Code Download  
Clone the repository to your local machine:  

```bash  
git clone https://github.com/CheUhxg/BridgeRouter.git  
cd BridgeRouter  
```  

## Execution 🔥  

The directory structure of the BridgeRouter project is as follows:  

```  
BridgeRouter/  
├── identifier/   # Static analysis tool  
├── trigger/      # Trigger code generation tool  
├── linux/        # Linux kernel source code  
└── README.md     # This documentation  
```  

### 0. Install Software Dependencies  

Install dependencies using the following command:  

```bash  
./build.sh  
```  

### 1. Using the identifier Tool  
The `identifier` tool analyzes kernel source code to identify specific objects. Run it with:  

```bash  
./run.sh identifier  
```  

### 2. Using the trigger Tool  
The `trigger` tool generates code to exploit specific kernel objects based on the output from `identifier`. Run it with:  

```bash  
./run.sh trigger  
```  

## Acknowledgments & Support 😘

### Notes for Technical Translation:  
1. **Tool Names**: Retain original names (`identifier`, `trigger`) for consistency.  
2. **Code Blocks**: Keep commands and directory structures unchanged.  
3. **Terminology**: Critical terms like "exploit generation" and "trigger code" align with cybersecurity conventions.  
4. **Tone**: Maintain a professional yet approachable style suitable for technical documentation.
